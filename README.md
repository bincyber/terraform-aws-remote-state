# Terraform Module: terraform-aws-remote-state

This Terraform module provisions a S3 bucket for remote state storage and a DynamoDB table for state locking.

The S3 bucket is created with versioning, server-side encryption, and logging enabled. A custom KMS encryption key is created for use with the S3 bucket. Bucket access logs are sent to a seperate S3 bucket.

2 IAM groups are created allowing varying levels of access to the S3 bucket:

| Group | Description
| -------- | --------
| terraform_rw_access | allows full access to the S3 bucket
| terraform_ro_access | allows read-only access to the S3 bucket


## Prerequisites

Terraform version 0.12.0 or newer is required.


### Usage

Use the module in Terraform code:

    module "remote_state_setup" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/bincyber/terraform-aws-remote-state"

      aws_region          = "us-east-1"
      aws_environment     = "Prod"
      s3_bucket_name      = "terraform-remote-state"
      dynamodb_table_name = "terraform-state-locking"
    }
